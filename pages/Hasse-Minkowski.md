- Hasse-Minkowski Theorem. Let $f$ be a rational quadratic form of dimension $n$. Then $f$ is isotropic ($\exists v\neq 0, f(v)=0$) iff it's isotropic *locally* at all places.
	- We first prove this for the case $n=3$.
- ### Local treatment (of $\mathbb Q$)
- ### Legendre's proof of the ternary case
- This is the ingenious proof via infinite descent. *Doesn't require Hilbert symbols.*
	- Catch: This proof doesn't work over number fields.
- Global criterion. $ax^2+by^2=z^2$ has a solution $(x,y,z)\neq(0,0,0)$ iff $b\in\operatorname{Nm}(\mathbb Q[\sqrt{a}\,]^\times)$, assuming $b\neq 0$.
	- Corollary. If $\lambda\in\operatorname{Nm}(\mathbb Q[\sqrt{a}\,]^\times)$, then solutions to $ax^2+by^2=1$ and $ax^2+(\lambda b)y^2=1$ are in bijection.
- Proof of H-M, $n=3$ case. Suppose $ax^2+by^2=1$ is solvable locally everywhere, $a,b$ nonzero square-free integers, $1\leq |a|\leq|b|$. We construct global solutions $(x,y)$ by induction on $|a|+|b|$.
	- Base case $a,b\in\{\pm 1\}$. Using condition at $v=\infty$ we have either $a=1$ or $b=1$, so trivial.
	- Inductive step. Observe $a$ is a square mod $b$, so $\exists\, r,c\in\Z$ satisfying $bc=r^2-a$. Taking $0\leq r<|b|$, we have $|c|<|b|$. By last corollary, we pass to the equation $ax^2+cy^2=1$. QED.
- ### Number theoretic proof of the ternary case
- Hasse norm theorem. Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, then $a\in K^\times\subset K_v^\times$ is a norm from $L_v$ for all but finitely many $v$, and it is a global norm iff it's a local norm everywhere.
	- Proof. We know $H^1(G,\mathbf{C}_L)=0$, then by periodicity of Tate cohomology of cyclic group, we have $\hat H^{-1}(G,\mathbf{C}_L)=0$, i.e. $\hat H^0(G,L^\times)\longrightarrow\hat H^0(G,\mathbb I_L)$ is injective. This is precisely
	- $$\begin{equation*}K^\times/\operatorname{Nm}(L^\times)\longrightarrow\bigoplus_vK_v^\times/\operatorname{Nm}(L_v^\times).\end{equation*}$$
	- QED.
- Brauer groups. We need the left half of the following SES, $K$ any global field.
	- $$0 \longrightarrow \operatorname{Br}(K) \longrightarrow \bigoplus_v\operatorname{Br}(K_v) \longrightarrow \mathbb Q/\Z \longrightarrow 0$$
	- This relates to our objective as follows. For a field $k$ and $a,b\in k^\times$, there is a quaternion algebra $(a,b)_k$ which represents a class in $\operatorname{Br}(k)$. Its norm form is isomorphic to $\langle 1,-a,-b,ab\rangle$.
		- Two quaternion algebras are isomorphic iff their norm forms are isomorphic.
	- $(a,b)_k$ represents the identity of $\operatorname{Br}(k)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ its norm form is isotropic $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\langle a,b\rangle$ represents $1$.
