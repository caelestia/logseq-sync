- On a smooth manifold, the first order symbol (Atiyah) sequence is
  $$0\to\mathcal{A}\xrightarrow{\iota}\mathcal{D}^1\xrightarrow{\sigma}\mathcal{T}\to0$$
- This is a SES of locally free *right* $\mathcal{A}$-modules. The idea of a connection is closely related to the obstruction of writing a section $T$ of $\mathcal{D^1}$ into a sum $\iota(a)+\sigma(T)$.
- Recall that $\mathcal{D}^1$ is defined as the $\R$-linear endormorphisms of $\mathcal{A}$ satisfying $[T,f]=\sigma(T)f\in\Gamma(\mathcal{A})$.
- A section $\nabla$ of $\sigma$ is a connection of the trivial line bundle.
	- In local coordinates, $\mathcal{D}^1\simeq\mathcal{A}\oplus\mathcal{T}$ canonically, because we can exponentiate (i.e. parallel transport) a tangent vector at any point into a vector field around the point.
