- On a smooth manifold, the first order symbol (Atiyah) sequence is
  $$0\to\mathcal{A}\xrightarrow{\iota}\mathcal{D}^1\xrightarrow{\sigma}\mathcal{T}\to0$$
- This is a SES of locally free *right* $\mathcal{A}$-modules. The idea of a connection is closely related to the obstruction to writing a section $T$ of $\mathcal{D^1}$ into a sum $\iota(a)+\sigma(T)$.
- Recall that $\mathcal{D}^1$ is defined as  the property that $[T,f]=\sigma(T)f\in\Gamma(\mathcal{A})$.
