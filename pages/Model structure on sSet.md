- Our goal is to define the three classes of special morphisms on $\mathsf{sSet}$, and check that they satisfies the axioms of a model category:
	- (M1) All three classes are closed under retracts;
	- (M2) Weak equivalences satisfies 2 out of 3;
	- (M3) acyclic cofibrations have the left lifting property against fibrations, and cofibrations have the left lifting property against acyclic fibrations.
