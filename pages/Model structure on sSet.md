- Our goal is to define the three classes of special morphisms on $\mathsf{sSet}$, and check that they satisfies the axioms of a model category:
	- (M0) The category is complete and cocomplete;
	- (M1) all three classes are closed under retracts;
	- (M2) weak equivalences satisfies 2 out of 3;
	- (M3) acyclic cofibrations have the left lifting property against fibrations;
	- (M4) cofibrations have the left lifting property against acyclic fibrations;
	- (M5) every morphism can be factorized as a cofibration with an acyclic fibration;
	- (M6) every morphism can be factorized as an acyclic cofibration with with a fibration.
- ### Definitions
- The cofibrations are the monomorphisms.
- The fibrations are the morphisms having right lifting property against the horn inclusions $\Lambda^n_k\to\Delta^n$.
- Kan complexes are the fibrant objects, equivalently, those with the horn filling property.
- A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is a weak homotopy equivalence iff, for every Kan complex $Z$, the induced map $f^*:[Y,Z]\to[X,Z]$ is a bijection.
- ## Checking the axioms
- ### Trivial things
- M0. This is known for presheaf categories.
- M2. Given $X\xrightarrow{f}Y\xrightarrow{g}Z$, any Kan complex $W$, we have $f^*g^*=(gf)^*$. Since bijections satisfy 2 out of 3, we're done.
- M1. This is easy for all three classes:
	- Monomorphisms are closed under
