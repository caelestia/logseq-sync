- Our goal is to define the three classes of special morphisms on $\mathsf{sSet}$, and check that they satisfies the axioms of a model category:
	- (M0) The category is complete and cocomplete;
	- (M1) all three classes are closed under retracts;
	- (M2) weak equivalences satisfies 2 out of 3;
	- (M3) acyclic cofibrations have the left lifting property against fibrations, and cofibrations have the left lifting property against acyclic fibrations;
	- (M4) every morphism can be factorized as a cofibration with an acyclic fibration;
	- (M5) every morphism can be factorized as an acyclic cofibration with with an
