- This fact follows from Sard's theorem.
- Lemma. Any continuous map $f:M\to N$ between smooth manifolds is homotopic to a smooth map.
- Theorem. If $n<m$, then $\pi_n(S^m)=0$.
- Proof. By Sard's theorem, the image of any smooth map $f:I^n\to S^m$ only consists of critical points (Jacobian has rank $<m$), so (the intersection with any chart of) the image is a null set. In particular, $f$ is not surjective. QED
- ### Proof of Lemma
- First consider the case $N=\R$. By Weierstrass approximation theorem (Stone-Weierstrass), for any $\varepsilon>0$ there is a smooth function $
