- Cauchy's formula for smooth functions. Let $f:U\to C$ smooth, $U\subset C$ open and contains $\overline D$, $D=B(0,r)$. Then for all $\xi\in D$, we have
	- $$f(\xi)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial D}\frac{f(z)}{z-\xi}+\int_D\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar z}\frac{dz\wedge d\bar z}{z-\xi}$$
	- Proof. Check absolute integrability of $1/z$ (w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure) and take limit of small disk around $\xi$. QED

- Holomorphic implicit/inverse function theorem. Omitted.
	- Proof (inverse). Compute $\bar\partial f^{-1}=0$.
- Corollary. Holomorphic + bijective implies biholomorphic.
	- Proof.
- Convergence of holomorphic functions. Uniform convergence on compact subsets implies convergence to holomorphic function.
- Montel's theorem. = compactness of bounded family. If $U\subset C^n$ and $f_k$ uniformly bounded holomorphic, then there exists a subsequence converging to a holomorphic function.
- ### Complex manifold
- A complex manifold of dimension $n$ is $(X,(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)_\alpha)$, $X$ is a Hausdorff top space, $U_\alpha$ countable cover, $\phi_\alpha:U_\alpha\to C^n$ are homeomorphisms, and transition functions $\phi_\alpha\circ\phi_\beta^{-1}$ are holomorphic.

- Maximum principle. $U\subset C^n$ open, $f:U\to C$ holomorphic. If $|f|$ attains a maximum, then $f$ is constant.
	- Proof. Let $f=u+iv$. $|f|$ is constant, WLOG let $1=|f|^2=u^2+v^2$. Take derivatives and apply C-R equations. QED
- ### Almost complex structure
- Let $M$ be a real/complex manifold. The real tangent space $T_x(M)$ at $x$ is the set of equivalence classes of curves $\gamma:(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\to M$, $\varepsilon>0$ satisfying $\gamma(0)=x$. Let $\gamma\sim\delta$ iff $\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}(\varphi\circ\gamma)(t)=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}(\varphi\circ\delta)(t)$ for some chart $(U,\varphi)$ around $x$.
- If $M$ is a complex manifold, it induces an almost complex structure by $J_x:T_x(M)\to T_x(M)$, $[\gamma]\mapsto[\varphi^{-1}(i\varphi\circ\gamma)]$.
- Denote the  complexified tangent space at $x$ by $T_{x,C}(M)$.
