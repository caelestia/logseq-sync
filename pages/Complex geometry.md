- Cauchy's formula for smooth functions. Let $f:U\to C$ smooth, $U\subset C$ open and contains $\overline D$, $D=B(0,r)$. Then for all $\xi\in D$, we have
	- $$f(\xi)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial D}\frac{f(z)}{z-\xi}+\int_D\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar z}\frac{dz\wedge d\bar z}{z-\xi}$$
	- Proof. Check absolute integrability of $1/z$ (w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure) and take limit of small disk around $\xi$. QED
	- POU?
- Holomorphic implicit/inverse function theorem. Omitted.
	- Proof (inverse). Compute $\bar\partial f^{-1}=0$.
- Corollary. Holomorphic + bijective implies biholomorphic.
	- Proof.
- Convergence of holomorphic functions. Uniform convergence on compact subsets implies convergence to holomorphic function.
- Montel's theorem. = compactness of bounded family. If $U\subset C^n$ and $f_k$ uniformly bounded holomorphic, then there exists a subsequence converging to a holomorphic function.
