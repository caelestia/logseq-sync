- Cauchy's formula for smooth functions. Let $f:U\to C$ smooth, $U\subset C$ open and contains $\overline D$, $D=B(0,r)$. Then for all $\xi\in D$, we have
	- $$f(\xi)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial D}\frac{f(z)}{z-\xi}+\int_D\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar z}\frac{dz\wedge d\bar z}{z-\xi}$$
	- Proof. Check absolute integrability of $1/z$ (w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure) and take limit of small disk around $\xi$. QED
	- POU?
- Holomorphic implicit/inverse function theorem. Omitted.
	- Proof (inverse). Compute $\bar\partial f^{-1}=0$.
- Corollary. Holomorphic + bijective implies biholomorphic.
	- Proof.
- Convergence of holomorphic functions. Uniform convergence on compact subsets implies convergence to holomorphic function.
- Montel's theorem. = compactness of bounded family. If $U\subset C^n$ and $f_k$ uniformly bounded holomorphic, then there exists a subsequence converging to a holomorphic function.
- ### Complex manifold
- A complex manifold of dimension $n$ is $(X,(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)_\alpha)$, $X$ is a Hausdorff top space, $U_\alpha$ countable cover, $\phi_\alpha:U_\alpha\to C^n$ are homeomorphisms, and transition functions $\phi_\alpha\circ\phi_\beta^{-1}$ are holomorphic.

- Maximum principle. $U\subset\C^n$ open, $f:U\to C$ holomorphic. If $|f|$ attains a maximum, then $f$ is constant.
	- Proof. Let $f=u+iv$. $|f|$ is constant, WLOG let $1=|f|^2=u^2+v^2$. Take derivatives and apply C-R equations. QED
- ### Almost complex structure
- Let $M$ be a real/complex manifold. The real tangent space $T_x(M)$ at $x$ is the set of equivalence classes of curves $\gamma:(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\to M$, $\varepsilon>0$ satisfying $\gamma(0)=x$. Let $\gamma\sim\delta$ iff $\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}(\varphi\circ\gamma)(t)=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}(\varphi\circ\delta)(t)$ for some chart $(U,\varphi)$ around $x$.
- If $M$ is a complex manifold, it induces an almost complex structure by $J_x:T_x(M)\to T_x(M)$, $[\gamma]\mapsto[\varphi^{-1}(i\varphi\circ\gamma)]$.
- Denote the complexified tangent space at $x$ by $T_{x,\C}(M)=T_x(M)\otimes_\R\C$. It has $\C$-basis $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial\bar z_i}\}_i$.
	- Define $T^{1,0}_x(M), T^{0,1}_x(M)$ as $\pm i$-eigenspaces of $J_x$.
- Jacobian. Let $f:X\to Y$ holomorphic, then the Jacobian $J_f$ at $x$ is the $\C$-linear component $df_\C:T^{1,0}_xX\to T^{1,0}_{f(x)}Y$, written in the bases $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}\}_i$.
- Submersion and Immersion. If $r=\dim Y\leq X$ (resp. $r=\dim X\leq Y$) and $J_f$ has max rank $r$ at every point $x\in X$.
- Closed submanifold $Y\subset X$ of codimension $k$. Criterion: If around each $x$ there is an open nhood $U$ and a submersion $f:U\to\C^k$ such that $Y\cap U=f^{-1}(0)$.
	- Example. Complete intersection in $\mathbb{P}^n$. Let $(F_i)_{i=1}^k$ homogeneous polynomials in $n+1$ variables, $k\leq n$. If $\left(\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial z_j}\right)_{i,j}$ has maximal rank $k$ on $\{x\in\C^{n+1}:F_1=\cdots=F_k=0\}$, then the common zero locus defines a closed submanifold of codimension $k$ of $\mathbb{P}^n$.
- ### Holomorphic vector bundles
- A $\C$-vector bundle $\pi:E\to X$ is called holomorphic if $E$ is a complex manifold (compatible with the fibers) and $\pi$ is holomorphic.
	- Equivalently, this means the local trivializations $\pi^{-1}(U)\simeq U\times\C^r$ are biholomorphic.
	- Vector bundle construction holds for holomorphic transition functions $g_{ij}:U_i\cap U_j\to\operatorname{GL}_r(\C)$ satisfying the cocycle condition $g_{ij}g_{jk}g_{ki}=1$ and $g_{ii}=1$. This is obvious by patching sheaves.
- Example. The tautological line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-1)=\{(x,v)\in\mathbb{CP}^n\times\C^{n+1}:v\in x\}$ over $\mathbb{CP}^n$.
- ### Integrability
- The Nijenhuis tensor is defined by $N_J(A,B)=[A,B]+J[JA,B]+J[A,JB]-[JA,JB]$.
- $N_J=0$ iff the Lie bracket of two $(0,1)$-vector fields is again of type $(0,1)$. Or $(1,0)$.
	- Let $A,B\in\Gamma(X^{0,1})$, so $A+iJA=B+iJB=0$. We have
	- $$C:=[2A,2B]=[A-iJA,B-iJB]=[A,B]-i[JA,B]-i[A,JB]-[JA,JB].$$
	- $$2C^{1,0}=C+iJC=N_J(A,B)+iJN_J(A,B)=2N_J(A,B)^{1,0}.$$
	- Since in $T_{\mathbb{C}}$, we have $\overline{T^{0,1}}=T^{1,0}$, integrability of these subbundles are equivalent, and thus they are also equivalent to vanishing of $N_J$. QED
- If $J$ is given by a complex structure, then $T^{0,1}$ and $T^{1,0}$ are integrable, and $N_J=0$.
- The converse is the Newlander–Nirenberg theorem.
