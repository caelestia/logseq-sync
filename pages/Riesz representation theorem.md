- We discuss the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem, which is too long to fit in the title.
- ### Setup
- The setup. Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Denote by $C_c(X)$ the Banach space of compactly supported continous functions, with $\|\cdot\|_\infty$.
	- It has subspaces $C(K)$ containing functions supported in $K$, where $K\subset X$ is compact.
- We *would* like to define a (real) Radon measure as a linear functional on this space; however, this is too restrictive as not even the Lebesgue measure on $\R$ satisfies this.
	- To fix this, we introduce a better *topology* on $C_c(X)$. It is, incidentally, not a normed space, only a locally compact topological vector space.
- Definition. Put $\mathrm K(X):=\varinjlim_K C(K)$, with the colimit (=finest) topology.
	- As a vector space, this is clearly same as $C_c(X)$. However the topology is finer unless $X$ is compact. A sequence $(f_n)_n$ converges to $0$ in $\mathrm K(X)$ iff $\|f_n\|_\infty\to0$ and they're eventually supported in the same $K$.
- A Radon measure is a *continuous* linear functional $\mu:\mathrm K(X)\to\R$.
	- In other words: $\mu$ is linear and for each compact subset $K$ there exists $M_K>0$ such that $|\mu(f)|\leq M_K\|f\|_\infty$ for all $f\in C(K)$.
	- Composing with the universal map yields a linear functional $\int_Xd\mu:C_c(X)\to\R$.
- Remark. On [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz%E2%80%93Markov%E2%80%93Kakutani_representation_theorem), positive linear functionals on $C_c(X)$ are considered instead. These are precisely the positive Radon measures: For $K\subset X$, we pick a function $\varphi$ which is identically $1$ on $K$ with compact support, and put $M_K=\mu(\varphi)$.
- ### Statement
- Theorem. There is a bijective correspondence between positive linear functionals (=positive Radon measures) and Borel measures $\mu$ satisfying (i), (ii) and (iii) below.
	- (i) Finite on compact sets. $\mu(K)<\infty$ for compact $K$.
	- (ii) Outer regularity. $\mu(E)=\inf\{\mu(U):U\supset E,\text{ open}\}$ for all Borel set $E$.
	- (iii) Inner regurity on *open* sets. $\mu(U)=\sup\{\mu(K):K\subset U,\text{ compact}\}$ for open $U$.
- The bijection maps the functional $\Lambda:C_c(X)\to\R$ to the unique Borel measure $\mu$ satisfying
	- $\mu(U)=\sup\{\Lambda(f):f\in C_c(X),0\leq f\leq 1,\operatorname{supp}(f)\subset U\}$ for all open $U$.
