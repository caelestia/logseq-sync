- We discuss the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem, which is too long to fit in the title.
- The setup. Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Denote by $C_c(X)$ the Banach space of compactly supported continous functions, with $\|\cdot\|_\infty$.
	- It has subspaces $C(K)$ where $K\subset X$ is compact.
- We *would* like to define a (real) Radon measure as a linear functional on this space; however, this is too restrictive as not even the Lebesgue measure on $\R$ satisfies this.
	- To fix this, we introduce a better *topology* on $C_c(X)$. It is, incidentally, not a normed space, only a tvs.
