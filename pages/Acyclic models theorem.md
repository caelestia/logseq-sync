- Let $\mathscr{C}$ be a category. A set of models simply means a subset $\mathcal{M}\subset\operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$.
- We say that a functor $T:\mathscr{C}\to\mathsf{Ab}$ (or $R\text{-}\mathsf{Mod}$) is
	- Free on $\mathcal{M}$ with model basis $\{x_i\in T(M_i):i\in I,\,M_i\in\mathcal{M}\}$, if for all $C\in\operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$, the set $\{T(f)(x_i):i\in I,\, f\in\operatorname{Hom}(M_i,C)\}$ is a basis for $T(C)$.
- Lemma. If $T$ is free on $\mathcal{M}$, then it is a projective in the category $\mathsf{Ab}^{\mathscr{C}}=\mathsf{Fct}(\mathscr{C},\mathsf{Ab})$.
	- Proof. For each $i\in I$, let $T_i$ be the functor that's free on a single model $\{M_i\}$ with basis $\{x_i\}$. Then $T=\bigoplus_{i\in I}T_i$ because colimits are pointwise in the functor category. Hence it suffices to prove
- Now consider a functor $T_\bullet:\mathscr{C}\to\mathsf{Ch}_{\geq0}(\mathsf{Ab})$. We say it is
	- Free on $\mathcal{M}$, if $T_i$ is free on $\mathcal{M}$ for all $i\geq 0$.
	- Acyclic on $\mathcal{M}$, if $T(M)$ is acyclic for all $M\in\mathcal{M}$.
- Denote its $i$-th homology as $H_i(T_\bullet)$.
