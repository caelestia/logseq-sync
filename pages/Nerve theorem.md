- Fix $X$ paracompact Hausdorff. Let $\mathcal{U}=\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a locally finite good open cover (viz. all nonempty finite intersections are contractible), we have the nerve $N_\mathcal{U}$, which can be viewed as a simplicial set (or, a simplicial complex).
- **Theorem**. There is a homotopy equivalence $h_\mathcal{U}:X\to|N_\mathcal{U}|$.
- First, recall that $|N_\mathcal{U}|$ has a cell for each non-degenerate simplex
