- *Serre* proof of Lagrange's four squares thm:
	- (Aubry, Davenport and Cassels) Consider an inner product on $\mathbb Q^N$, that is, a positive definite bilinear form $\sum_{i,j}^Na_{ij}X_iY_j$. Put $f(x)=x\cdot x$. Suppose that the $f$ represents some number $n\in Z$ over $\mathbb Q$, then it also represents it over $\Z$, under the following:
		- Assumption: For every $x\in\mathbb Q^N$, there exists $y\in\Z^n$ such that $f(x-y)<1$.
