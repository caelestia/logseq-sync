### Locally compact subgroups are closed
- Proposition. Let $H\leq G$, where $G$ is Hausdorff and $H$ is locally compact. Then $H$ is closed.
	- Proof. Consider the closure of $H$; this is also a subgroup of $G$. Apply the following lemma. QED
- Lemma. If $H$ is locally compact dense subset of a Hausdorff space $X$, then $H$ is open.
	- Proof. Fix $x\in H$. Take an open neighborhood $U\subset X$, such that the closure $K$ of $U\cap H$ in $H$ is compact. Then $U\setminus K$ is open, so intersects $H$.
