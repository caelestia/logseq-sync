- Why the countability in the definition of $\sigma$-algebra and countable additivity?
- Elementary fact:
	- Given $(a_i)_{i\in I}$, $a_i\in\R\setminus\{0\}$, if $I$ is uncountable, then $\sum_ia_i=\infty$.
- However, because we work in $[0,\infty]$ anyway, this does not itself prevent a higher additivity.
- If we think about the essence definition of a measure, "continuous valuation on a lattice":
	- Let $(A,\wedge,\vee)$ be a distributive lattice.
	- Let $(E,+)$ be a totally ordered commutative monoid. Usually $E=[0,\infty]$.
	- The "measure" is a function $A\to E$, subject to:
		- Modularity. $\mu(x)+\mu(y)=\mu(x\vee y)+\mu(x\wedge y)$.
		- \*Strictness. $A$ is bounded below and $\mu(\bot)=0$.
		- \*Monotonicity. $x\leq y\implies\mu(x)\leq\mu(y)$.
		- Continuity.
