- Why the countability in the definition of $\sigma$-algebra and countable additivity?
- Elementary fact:
	- Given $(a_i)_{i\in I}$, $a_i\in\R\setminus\{0\}$, if $I$ is uncountable, then $\sum_ia_i=\infty$.
- However, because we work in $[0,\infty]$ anyway, this does not itself prevent a higher additivity.
- If we think about the essence definition of a measure, "continuous valuation on a lattice":
	- Let $(A,\wedge,\vee)$ be a distributive lattice.
