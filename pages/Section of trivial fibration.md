- Given a morphism of simplicial sets $p:X\to Y$ having the right lifting property against boundary inclusions $\partial\Delta^n\to\Delta^n$, we will find a section $s$ to $p$, and a homotopy $sp\simeq\mathrm{id}_X$.
- Recall the Eilenberg-Zilber lemma: every simplex has a unique expression as a degeneracy of a non-degenerate simplex.
- **Base case**, $n=0$. By the lifting property
