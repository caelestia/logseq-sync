- Given a morphism of simplicial sets $p:X\to Y$ having the right lifting property against boundary inclusions $\partial\Delta^n\to\Delta^n$, we will find a section $s$ to $p$, and a homotopy $sp\simeq\mathrm{id}_X$.
- Recall the Eilenberg-Zilber lemma: every simplex has a unique expression as a degeneracy of a non-degenerate simplex.
- **Base case**, $n=0$. By the lifting property against $\varnothing\to\Delta^1$, $p$ is surjective on vertices. Define $s$ as any section of this.
- **Inductive step**, $n>0$. Suppose that $s$ is constructed for all simplices of degree $<n$, as well as all simplices degenerated from such by $ss_i=s_is$.
