- To recap, we have defined a comparison map $\psi_X:C(\Z X)\to S_\bullet(|X|)$ and checked it's a quasi-isomorphism for simplices. So we need to study its interaction with the colimit next.
- ### Treatment of LHS
	- Observe that $C(\Z X)=\varinjlim_{(n,x)}C(\Z\Delta^n)$. Indeed, in the beginning of ((69764c6d-0883-4e9a-a94b-5bea775aca45)) we showed that $\Z-$ (denoted $\operatorname{Free}_*$ there) is a left adjoint, so preserves colimits; and $C(-)$ is an equivalence by Dold-Kan.
- ### Singular homology
	- Lemma. Let $Y_0\hookrightarrow Y_1\hookrightarrow\cdots\hookrightarrow Y_\alpha\hookrightarrow\cdots$ (indexed by ordinals $\alpha$ less than some $\sigma$) be closed embeddings of T1 spaces, $Y=\varinjlim_\alpha Y_\alpha$. If $A$ is compact, then any map $A\to Y$ factors through some $Y_\alpha$.
		- Proof. Observe that, if $B\subset Y$ satisfies $B\cap(Y_{\alpha+1}\setminus Y_{\alpha})$ is finite for all $\alpha$, then $B$ is closed; but the same applies to any subset of $B$, so $B$ is discrete. Hence if $B$ is infinite, it can't be compact. QED
	- Corollary. If $A$ is a compact subset of a CW complex, then it only intersects finitely many open cells. Moreover, it's contained in a finite subcomplex.
		- Proof. In the above, let each $Y_{\alpha+1}\setminus Y_\alpha$ be an open cell. Then $B$ can only intersect finitely many of them. It is clear by induction that closed cells are contained in finite subcomplexes, and the result follows. QED
	- Since (1) the geometric realization commutes with all colimits, (2) homology commutes with filtered colimits, and the section above, we've successfully reduced the comparison to finite simplicial sets (viz. those having a finite number of non-degenerate simplices).
	- By (1) again, the pushout $Y'=Y\cup D^n$ induces a short exact sequence $0\to S_\bullet(Y)\to $
	- The question now reduces to the Mayer-Vietoris theorem. Since relative CW complexes are always cofibrations, this is known.
