- Let $G$ be an topological abelian group.
- A filter $\mathcal{F}$ is called a Cauchy filter, if for every neighborhood $U$ (of $0$), there exists $A\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A-A\subset U$.
- From the example $\mathbb Q\leadsto\R$, we learnt that a point in the completion corresponds to multiple Cauchy filters. Thus we introduce:
- A minimal Cauchy filter is a Cauchy filter which does not properly contain another Cauchy filter.
- **Proposition**. Given a Cauchy filter $\mathcal{F}$, there is a unique minimal Cauchy filter $\mathcal{F}^\dagger$ contained in $\mathcal{F}$.
	- Proof. Define $\mathcal{F}^\dagger$ as $\{W:W\supset A+U,\,A\in\mathcal{F},U\ni0\text{ open}\}$.
