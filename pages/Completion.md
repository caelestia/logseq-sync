## Setup
- Let $G$ be a topological abelian group.
- A filter $\mathcal{F}$ is called a Cauchy filter, if for every neighborhood $U$ (of $0$), there exists $A\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A-A\subset U$.
- From the example $\mathbb Q\leadsto\R$, we learnt that a point in the completion corresponds to multiple Cauchy filters. Thus we introduce:
- A minimal Cauchy filter is a Cauchy filter which does not properly contain another Cauchy filter.
- **Lemma.** Given a Cauchy filter $\mathcal{F}$, there is a unique minimal Cauchy filter $\mathcal{F}^\dagger$ contained in $\mathcal{F}$.
	- Proof. Define $\mathcal{F}^\dagger$ as the filter generated by the filter base $\{A+U:A\in\mathcal{F},\,U\ni0\text{ open}\}$. This is a filter (base) because
	  $$(A+U)\cap(B+V)\supset(A\cap B)+(U\cap V).$$
	- It is Cauchy because for any nhood $U$, we can pick a nhood $W$ such that $W+W-W\subset U$ and $A\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A-A\subset W$. Then
	  $$(A+W)-(A+W)=A-A+W-W\subset W+W-W\subset U.$$
	- Finally, we prove it's minimal. Suppose $\mathcal{G}\subset\mathcal{F}^\dagger$ is Cauchy, $A+U\notin\mathcal{G}$. Take $B\in\mathcal{G}$ such that $B-B\subset U$. Since $A,B\in\mathcal{F}$, there is $x\in A\cap B$. Then $\mathcal{G}\ni B\subset x+U\subset A+U$, a contradiction. QED
- Let $\hat G$ be the set of minimal Cauchy filters on $G$.
- ## Group structure
- For $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}$ minimal Cauchy filters, define $\mathcal{F}+\mathcal{G}$ as the Cauchy filter generated by the base $\{F+G:F\in\mathcal{F},G\in\mathcal{G}\}$.
- And $-\mathcal{F}$ is the Cauchy filter generated by $\{-F:F\in\mathcal{F}\}$.
- This turns $\hat G$ into an abelian group with identity element $\mathcal{N}_0=\{U\ni0\}$.
- The natural map $\iota:G\to\hat G$ given by $g\mapsto \mathcal{N}_g=g+\mathcal{N}_0$ is a group homomorphism.
- ## Topology
- Let a nhood basis of $\hat0$ be given by the sets $\tilde U:=\{\mathcal{F}\in\hat G:U\in\mathcal{F}\}$ where $U\in\hat0$.
- This makes $\hat G$ a topological abelian group.
- **Lemma.** The map $\iota$ is continuous with dense image.
	- Proof. $\iota$ is continuous by $\iota^{-1}(\mathcal{F}+\tilde U)=\iota^{-1}(\mathcal{F})+\iota^{-1}(\tilde U)=\iota^{-1}(\mathcal{F})+U$.
	- Now, to prove density, we show that there exists $\mathcal{N}_g\in\mathcal{F}+\tilde U$ for all $\mathcal{F}$ and $U$. Let $A+W\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A+W-(A+W)\subset U$ and take any $g\in A$. Then observe that $\mathcal{G}:=\mathcal{N}_g-\mathcal{F}$ contains $U$, i.e., $\mathcal{G}\in\tilde U$. QED
- **Lemma.** If $G$ is Hausdorff, then $\iota$ is an embedding.
	- Proof. The map $\iota:G\to\$
