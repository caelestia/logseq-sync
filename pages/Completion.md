## Setup
- Let $G$ be a topological abelian group.
- A filter $\mathcal{F}$ is called a Cauchy filter, if for every neighborhood $U$ (of $0$), there exists $A\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A-A\subset U$.
- From the example $\mathbb Q\leadsto\R$, we learnt that a point in the completion corresponds to multiple Cauchy filters. Thus we introduce:
- A minimal Cauchy filter is a Cauchy filter which does not properly contain another Cauchy filter.
- **Lemma**. Given a Cauchy filter $\mathcal{F}$, there is a unique minimal Cauchy filter $\mathcal{F}^\dagger$ contained in $\mathcal{F}$.
	- Proof. Define $\mathcal{F}^\dagger$ as the filter generated by the filter base $\{A+U:A\in\mathcal{F},\,U\ni0\text{ open}\}$. This is a filter (base) because
	  $$(A+U)\cap(B+V)\supset(A\cap B)+(U\cap V).$$
	- It is Cauchy because for any nhood $U$, we can pick a nhood $W$ such that $W+W-W\subset U$ and $A\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A-A\subset W$. Then
	  $$(A+W)-(A+W)=A-A+W-W\subset W+W-W\subset U.$$
	- It
