- Let $G$ be an topological abelian group.
- A filter $\mathcal{F}$ is called a Cauchy filter, if for every neighborhood $U$ (of $0$), there exists $A\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A-A\subset U$.
- From the example $\mathbb Q\leadsto\R$, we learnt that a point in the completion corresponds to multiple Cauchy filters. Thus we introduce:
