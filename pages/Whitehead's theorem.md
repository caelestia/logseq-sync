## Simplicial Sets
- ### Review of Kan complexes
- Definition. A Kan complex is a simplicial set where every horn has a filler.
	- [[Kan complexes are the fibrant objects]]
- For any topological space $X$, $\operatorname{Sing}_\bullet(X)$ is a Kan complex.
- The following lemmas won't be proven here.
	- Lemma. A Kan complex $X$ is contractible iff it is connected and $\pi_n(X,x)=1$ for every $n>0$ and $x\in X$, iff $X\to\Delta^0$ is a trivial Kan fibration.
	- Lemma (Long exact sequence of fibration). If $(X,x)\to(Y,y)$ is
