## Simplicial Sets
- ### Review of Kan complexes
- Definition. A Kan complex is a simplicial set where every horn has a filler.
	- [[Kan complexes are the fibrant objects]]
- For any topological space $X$, $\operatorname{Sing}_\bullet(X)$ is a Kan complex.
- The following lemmas won't be proven here.
	- Lemma. A Kan complex $X$ is contractible iff it is connected and $\pi_n(X,x)=1$ for every $n>0$ and every $x\in X$, iff $X\to\Delta^0$ is a trivial fibration.
		- [[Contractible Kan complexes]]
	- Lemma (Long exact sequence of fibration). If $(X,*)\to(Y,*)$ is a fibration of pointed Kan complexes, $(F,*)$ is the fiber over the base point, then $F$ is obviously a Kan complex and we have a long exact sequence
		- $$\cdots \rightarrow \pi _1(Y,*) \xrightarrow {\partial } \pi _{0}(F, *) \rightarrow \pi _0( X,*) \rightarrow \pi _0(Y,*).$$
- ### Weak homotopy equivalence
- Definition. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism of simplicial sets. We say $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if, for every Kan complex $Z$, the induced map $[Y,Z]\to[X,Z]$ is a bijection.
- Theorem. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism of Kan complexes. The following are equivalent:
	- (a) $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence;
	- (b) $f$ is a homotopy equivalence;
	- (c) $\pi_0(f)$ is a bijection, and for every $x\in X$ and $n>0$, $\pi_n(f):\pi_n(X,x)\to\pi_n(Y,f(x))$ is an isomorphism.
- Proof.
- (a) implies (b) directly follows from the definition. Since $X$ is a Kan complex, by surjectivity of $[Y,X]\to[X,X]$, there is $g:Y\to X$ such that $gf\simeq\mathrm{id}_X$. Now $fgf\simeq\mathrm{id}_Y\circ f$, so by injectivity of $[Y,Y]\to[X,Y]$ (because $Y$ is a Kan complex), $fg\simeq\mathrm{id}_Y$.
- (b) implies (c) is the homotopy invariance, which is clear since $\pi_n(-)=[S^n,-]$. For turning the homotopy equivalence into a pointed one, see [here](https://kerodon.net/tag/04GD). Note that this step requires $X,Y$ be Kan complexes.
- (c) implies (a). First, factor $f$ as $X\to Z\to Y$, where $X\to Z$ is a trivial cofibration and $Z\to Y$ is a fibration. Since $Z\to Y\to *$ is a fibration, $Z$ is a Kan complex. It remains to show that $f':Z\to Y$ is an acyclic fibration. By the two lemmas above, the fiber $F$ of $f'$ over any base point is contractible.
- We need to solve the following lifting problem:

- For this, we apply HELP to reduce to the case where $\sigma=c_y$, $y\in Y$. In details, since $\Delta^n$ is contractible, there is $y\in Y$ and a homotopy $\overline{h}:\Delta^1\times\Delta^n\to Y$ from $\sigma$ to $c_y$. For $c_y$, the desired map $\Delta^n\to Z$ exists by contractibility of $F_y:=f'^{-1}(y)$.
