## Simplicial Sets
- ### Review of Kan complexes
- Definition. A Kan complex is a simplicial set where every horn has a filler.
	- [[Kan complexes are the fibrant objects]]
- For any topological space $X$, $\operatorname{Sing}_\bullet(X)$ is a Kan complex.
- The following lemmas won't be proven here.
	- Lemma. A Kan complex $X$ is contractible iff it is connected and $\pi_n(X,x)=1$ for every $n>0$ and every $x\in X$, iff $X\to\Delta^0$ is a trivial fibration.
		- [[Contractible Kan complexes]]
	- Lemma (Long exact sequence of fibration). If $(X,*)\to(Y,*)$ is a fibration of pointed Kan complexes, $(F,*)$ is the fiber over the base point, then we have a long exact sequence
		- $$\cdots \rightarrow \pi _1(Y,*) \xrightarrow {\partial } \pi _{0}(F, *) \rightarrow \pi _0( X,*) \rightarrow \pi _0(Y,*).$$
- ### Weak homotopy equivalence
- Theorem. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism of Kan complexes. The following are equivalent:
	- (a) $f$ is a homotopy equivalence;
	- (b) $\pi_0(f)$ is a bijection, and for every $x\in X$ and $n>0$, $\pi_n(f):\pi_n(X,x)\to\pi_n(Y,f(x))$ is an isomorphism.
- Proof. (a) implies (b) is homotopy invariance, which is clear since $\pi_n(-)=[S^n,-]$.
