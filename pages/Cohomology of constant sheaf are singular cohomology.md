- Suppose $X$ is a locally contractible space. This is necessary as indicated by the Warsaw circle.
- In the following we describe the outline of the proof from Global Calculus. We need to assume all open sets $U$ are paracompact. In the more natural [proof via hypersheaves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06927) this condition can be removed.
- Let $S^\bullet$ be the complex of presheaves of singular cochains. $X$ is locally contractible means

  $$0 \longrightarrow \underline{A} \longrightarrow S^\bullet$$
- is a resolution.
- Now observe for all $k\geq 0$:
	- $S^k$ is flasque, viz. the restrictions $S^k(U)\to S^k(V)$ are surjective for all $V\subset U$ open.
	- $S^k$ satisfies the glueing axiom of sheaves: If sections $\sigma_i\in S^k(U_i)$ agree on pairwise intersections then there exists $\sigma\in S^k(\bigcup_iU_i)$ glueing them.
	- However, $S^k$ are not sheaves unless $k=0$, since the glueing is obviously not unique.
- Hence we sheafify to get a complex of sheaves
- $$0 \longrightarrow \underline{A} \longrightarrow \tilde S^\bullet$$
- To conclude the proof, we need
