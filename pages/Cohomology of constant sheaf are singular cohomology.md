- Suppose $X$ is a locally contractible space. This is necessary as indicated by the Warsaw circle.
- In the following we describe the outline of the proof from Global Calculus. We need to assume all open sets $U$ are paracompact. In the more natural [proof via hypersheaves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06927) this condition can be removed.
- Let $S^\bullet$ be the complex of presheaves of singular cochains. $X$ is locally contractible means
- $$0 \longrightarrow \underline{A} \longrightarrow S^\bullet$$
- is a resolution.
- Now observe:
	- $S^k$ is flasque, viz. the restrictions $S^k(U)\to S^k(V)$ are surjective for all $V\subset U$ open and $k$.
	- $S^k$ are not sheaves.
