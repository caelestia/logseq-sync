- Suppose $X$ is a locally contractible space. This is necessary as indicated by the Warsaw circle.
- In the following we describe the outline of the proof from Global Calculus. We need to assume all open sets $U$ are paracompact. The more natural (proof via hypersheaves)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06927].
